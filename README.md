# Codesigning-Models-and-Visualizations-for-Explainable-AI-in-Financial-Decision-Support-Systems
With this code we want to propose a novel method that enhances comprehension and subsequently boosts confidence in artificial intelligence models by illustrating the decision-making process visually. We suggest a co-design of the model and its visualization.
In order to run this code, download the "codesign.zip" folder, unzip it, and and sobstitute in the code the correct location of the folder in your system.
